# 🏡 Linear Regression - Housing Price Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is part of the **AI & ML Internship Task 3**.  
We implemented **Linear Regression** to predict house prices using dataset features like `area` and `bedrooms`.

## ⚙️ Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

## 🚀 Steps Performed
1. Loaded and explored dataset.
2. Selected `area` & `bedrooms` as features, `price` as target.
3. Split data into training & testing sets.
4. Trained **Linear Regression** model.
5. Evaluated model using:
   - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)  
   - Mean Squared Error (MSE)  
   - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)  
   - R² Score
6. Visualized **Actual vs Predicted Prices**.

## 📊 Sample Output
- Model coefficients represent how much price changes with respect to area & bedrooms.
- R² score indicates model accuracy.
